                            "'The virological and immunological effects of the immunomodulatory drugs used for COVID-19 remain unknown. We evaluated the impact of interleukin (IL)-6 blockade with tocilizumab on SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and the antibody response in patients with COVID-19. Prospective cohort study in patients admitted with COVID-19. Serial nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were measured for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and S-IgG/N-IgG titers, respectively. 138 patients with confirmed infection were included; 76 (55%) underwent IL-6 blockade. Median initial SOFA (p\\xa0=\\xa00•016) and SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p<0•001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test) were significantly higher among anti-IL-6 users. Patients under IL-6 blockade showed delayed viral clearance in the Kaplan-Meier curves (HR 0•35 [95%CI] [0•15-0•81], log-rank p\\xa0=\\xa00•014), but an adjusted propensity score matching model did not demonstrate a significant relationship of IL-6 blockade with viral clearance (HR 1•63 [0•35-7•7]). Cox regression showed an inverse association between SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and the initial viral load (HR 0•35 [0•11-0•89]). Patients under the IL-6 blocker showed shorter median time to seropositivity, higher peak antibody titers, and higher cumulative proportion of seropositivity in the Kaplan Meier curves (HR 3•1 [1•9-5] for S-IgG; and HR 3•0 [1•9-4•9] for N-IgG; log-rank p<0•001 for both). However, no significant differences between groups were found in either S-IgG (HR 1•56 [0•41-6•0]) nor N-IgG (HR 0•96 [0•26-3•5]) responses in an adjusted propensity score analysis. Our results suggest that in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, IL-6 blockade does not impair the viral specific antibody responses. Although a delayed viral clearance was observed, it was driven by a higher initial viral load. The study supports the safety of this therapy in patients with COVID-19.
